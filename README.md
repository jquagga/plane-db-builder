# plane-db-builder

Yes, I know I have to write documentation but this is as far as I've got so far! This is a basic python script which builds a custom version of the plane-alert-db csv file from the master sheet and the aircraft.csv.gz included in tar1090. Once set up with the query configs, you can run it anytime to generate updated files which can be used by planealert or upa.
